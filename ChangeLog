Version 1.0.4 - 13-Nov-2021:
  - Fixed bug where game crashed when asking the "ritual question";
    fnYESORNO() was declared as a SUB when it was infact a FUNCTION.

Version 1.0.3 - 12-Aug-2021:
  - Fixed bug where if all the population were assigned as workers then the
    number of farmers would be the same as the previous season, instead of 0.

  - Changed flood animation so it is slower but can be interrupted by
    pressing any key.
