# Yellow River Kingdom (aka Hamurabi)
**Port of the BBC Micro "Yellow River Kingdom" game to the Colour Maximite 2.**

The original version of [Yellow River Kingdom](http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=1996&h=h) was an edutainment title included on the BBC Micro Welcome Tape/Disc and is a variant on the classic [Hamurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi_(video_game)) game.

It was (c) BBC Soft, 1981 and written by Tom Hartley, Jerry Temple-Fry and Richard G Warner.

I like to think that every British child in the 80's and early 90's would either have played this game or at least watched someone else play it on their school BBC Micro - often, at least early on, there was only one BBC per school and it was wheeled from classroom to classroom on a special trolley along with its obligatory CUB Microtech monitor.

This version was ported to MMBasic 5.07 by Thomas Hugo Williams in 2021 starting from this source code: http://brandy.matrixnetwork.co.uk/examples/KINGDOM.

## FAQ

**1. What is the Colour Maximite 2 ?**

The Colour Maximite 2 is a small self contained "Boot to BASIC" computer inspired by the home computers of the early 80's such as the Tandy TRS-80, Commodore 64 and Apple II.

While the concept of the Colour Maximite 2 is borrowed from the computers of the 80's the technology
used is very much up to date.  Its CPU is an ARM Cortex-M7 32-bit RISC processor running at 480MHz
and it generates a VGA output at resolutions up to 800x600 pixels with up 65,536 colours.

The power of the ARM processor means it is capable of running BASIC at speeds comparable to running native machine-code on an 8-bit home computer with the additional advantage of vastly more memory and superior graphics and audio capabilities.
